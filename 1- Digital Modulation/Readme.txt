In this lab, we explored and implemented various digital modulation techniques using MATLAB, including BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM. The lab involved simulating these modulation schemes to understand their operation and characteristics, such as signal constellation diagrams and performance in an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Key activities included generating random data, performing modulation, transmitting through an AWGN channel, and demodulating at the receiver to evaluate system performance with varying signal-to-noise ratios.
