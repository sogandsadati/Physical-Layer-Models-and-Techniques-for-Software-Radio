AM Signal Analysis: We opened and analyzed the AM broadcast signal recorded at a central carrier frequency using a USRP. The analysis involved observing the frequency components of the signal to identify the main carrier and sidebands within a specific frequency range.
Demodulation: The AM signal was demodulated by extracting its magnitude to retrieve the baseband audio signal. This was performed using GNU Radio's Complex to Mag block to transition from complex to real values.
Audio Output: We configured the workflow to listen to the demodulated signal. This involved adjusting the sample rate to match typical audio playback requirements and using a Rational Resampler to modify the sample rate for audio compatibility. Additionally, we used a Multiply Const block to attenuate the signal to an appropriate level for audio output.
Filtering and Adjustments: The lab also involved dynamic manipulation of the signal using low-pass filters and variable sliders to optimize audio clarity and quality.
