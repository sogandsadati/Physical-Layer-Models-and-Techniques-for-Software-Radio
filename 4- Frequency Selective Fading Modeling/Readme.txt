Frequency Selective Fading Models:
Rayleigh Model: Implemented a channel model with no line-of-sight components, simulating typical non-line-of-sight conditions using a predefined number of sinusoids and random Doppler frequencies.
Rician Model: Modeled a channel with both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight components, adjusting the Rician K-factor and observing changes in the signal's behavior.
