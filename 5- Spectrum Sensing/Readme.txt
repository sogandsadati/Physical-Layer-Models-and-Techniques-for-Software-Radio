Energy Detector Implementation: Developed an energy detector to identify spectrum holes (white spaces) where no primary user (PU) signals are present. This involved comparing received signal energy against a predefined threshold to determine the presence or absence of PU signals.
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Analysis: Evaluated the performance of the energy detector through ROC analysis, which plots the probability of detection against the probability of false alarms. This helped assess the effectiveness of the energy detector at various threshold settings.
Practical Application: Applied the energy detector to OFDM signals to search for white spaces across different sub-carriers, using MATLAB for simulation. Adjustments to the threshold were explored to observe their impact on detection accuracy.
