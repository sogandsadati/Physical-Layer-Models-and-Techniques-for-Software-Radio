Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS): Implemented DSSS where a narrowband signal is spread over a wider bandwidth using a pseudo-random code. This technique enhances signal robustness against interference and eavesdropping. We generated a bit pattern, applied a pseudo-random sequence for spreading, and performed BPSK modulation of the spread signal.
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS): Explored FHSS by varying the carrier frequency of a signal periodically to minimize the effects of interference and jamming. We simulated the generation of a bit pattern, applied BPSK modulation, and executed frequency hopping over multiple carrier frequencies to demonstrate the resilience of FHSS in a jamming environment.
