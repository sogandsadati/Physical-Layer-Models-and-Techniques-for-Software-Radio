CDMA Transceiver Implementation: Developed a simulation to demonstrate the operation of a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) transceiver for multiple users. This involved using Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) technology to allow multiple users to transmit simultaneously over the same frequency band by assigning unique pseudorandom codes to each user.
Signal Transmission and Reception: Each user's signal was modulated using BPSK, combined with their unique pseudo-random noise (PN) sequence, and transmitted over a simulated AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel.
Demodulation and Decoding: At the receiver, the signals were demodulated by correlating with the same PN sequences used at the transmitter, effectively separating each user's data from the composite signal.
Performance Analysis: Analyzed the effectiveness of CDMA in handling multiple users by comparing the transmitted and received signals, ensuring the system's ability to correctly decode the signals despite the presence of noise.
