OFDM Transceiver Setup: We designed and implemented a basic OFDM system, utilizing the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) to generate OFDM signals and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) at the receiver to demodulate these signals. This process included generating random data, applying QAM modulation, and inserting a cyclic prefix to each OFDM symbol to combat inter-symbol interference.
Channel Simulation and Signal Reception: The OFDM signals were transmitted through a simulated AWGN channel. At the receiver, cyclic prefixes were removed, and the received signal was converted back from the frequency domain to recover the transmitted data.
Performance Evaluation: We analyzed the system's performance by varying the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and observing the bit error rate (BER) across different modulation schemes and SNR levels. This helped in understanding the robustness of OFDM under different channel conditions.
