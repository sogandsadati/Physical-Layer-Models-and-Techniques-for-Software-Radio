OFDM Transceiver under Fading Conditions: Implemented a basic OFDM transceiver that simulates transmission over a multipath fading channel, specifically a Rayleigh fading model. This involved generating OFDM symbols, applying QAM modulation, and transmitting these symbols through a fading channel modeled to include both the multipath effects and AWGN.
Signal Processing Techniques: Utilized IFFT for signal transmission and FFT at the receiver for demodulation. A cyclic prefix was added to each OFDM symbol to mitigate inter-symbol interference caused by multipath fading.
Performance Analysis: Compared the performance of the OFDM system under fading and AWGN conditions. This comparison was based on the Bit Error Rate (BER) calculations across varying SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) levels. Different modulation schemes (e.g., 16-QAM, 32-QAM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM) were also tested to observe their impact on system performance under different channel conditions.
Experimental Setup: Configured the MATLAB script to run simulations that vary SNR levels from -20 dB to +20 dB, plotting BER results to visually demonstrate how OFDM performs under different channel impairments and modulation schemes.
